    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I play the bass, guitar and enjoy music overall. I also like art and its history. I draw and sometimes paint. Right now, I’m working on Klimt’s “The Kiss” painting. I've played bass guitar since I was 9 and started learning guitar way after that. One of my biggest influences is Jimmy Page on guitar and Jaco Pastorius on bass. The art movement I hate the most is Cubism ( I hate Pablo Picasso). </p>

<h1>Dreams - Aspirations</h1>
<p>I aspire to become a sociologist or maybe a musician. I dream to open a record store or have a lot of records. I'd also like to study medicine but my sleep schedule would be a mess and I'd develop intense trauma (I want to specialize in psychiatry).</p>

<h1>Pets</h1>
<p>I have a Shih Tzu who is 5 years old. Her name is Luli. Her dad won a contest in New York since he had the nicest hair I don't know. People always compliment her on the street and kids feel special because she doesn't bite them (truth is, kids think everything they do is special. As if they had supernatural powers or something.) </p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>I recommend visiting a neighborhood in Bogotá called “San Felipe”. It is very artistic and cultural. I also would like to recommend a book for mystery and true crime lovers. “Satanás” By Mario Mendoza.</p>
